### Research Interests

I am a sociologist who uses both computational and qualitative methods to uncover hidden structures of economic and cultural complex systems. I am interested in understanding novelty, innovation, and disruption in knowledge and economy, with a particular focus on their relations to social inequality, interpretability and uncertainty.
